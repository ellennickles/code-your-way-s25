# Week 11 • Guest Feedback

## Assignment

### Part 1: Schedule Your Individual Meeting (Zoom)

- We will **not** meet as a class next Monday, April 24.
- Instead, schedule a 15-minute individual Zoom meeting with Ellen to discuss
  your project progress and timeline for the next two weeks.
- The meeting is not primarily for troubleshooting technical issues, but we can
  certainly arrange a separate follow-up time if needed!
