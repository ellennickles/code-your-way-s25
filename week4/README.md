## Assignment

Due next Monday night before class (we next meet Tuesday, Feb 18)

### Part 1: Practice

Some of these are tricky. Do the best you can to get a sense of the logical and
visual pattern(s). Your choice:
[Encode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/encode.md)
(output to input) or
[Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/decode.md)
(input to output)

1. [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/ioXnSfKXD) or

  ([this video](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/77-recursion) might help)

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Extending our work with loops and patterns (our last week of grids?!),
  progression is the theme this week: how can you represent continuous change(s)
  within the composition color, position, size, speed, etc. and/or over time? Is
  the quality of change gradual or uneven? For example, can you make an
  interactive sketch that maps order to chaos based on the mouse position, e.g.
  “order” on the left and “chaos” on the right (prompt from _Code as a Creative
  Medium_)? Can you extend an example or self-designed sketch from previous
  weeks with this week’s theme. If you worked with gradients in the past, what
  are other ways to demonstrate a shift? Just some ideas to get started, in
  addition to those in the Class Slides.

### Part 3: Command Line Scavenger Hunt

- Keep building your muscle memory with the command line and design a command
  line scavenger hunt for your classmates. Choose a creative theme—like a spaceship, castle, haunted house, or any setting you
  like. Your hunt will help others practice navigating directories and files
  while uncovering treasures (and maybe a few surprises).
- Requirements
  - Create **4 to 6 rooms** (directories/folders) for your scavenger hunt
  - Hide at least **2 treasures** (text files with clues, story pieces, or
    codes) and **1 danger** (a spooky twist, red herring, or warning)
  - Maybe add extra challenges, like secret rooms (nested folders) or decoy
    files or folders with misleading names to throw off your classmates and keep
    them on their toes.
- We’ll play each other’s scavenger hunts in class next week. Have fun with it!

### Part 4: Document

- Document your work. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
