## Assignment

- Due next Monday night, Feb 17.
- No class on Monday (it's Presidents’ Day)! We will meet on Tuesday, Feb 18.

### Part 1: Practice

Assemble and modify:

1. [Review loops](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/xTwj41nB9)
  (directions in sketch)

Use the [Encode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/encode.md)
and analyze the visual output to predict the input code:

2. [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/iu3hqCt1e)
3. [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/sTAx_W5n_)

Use the [Decode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/decode.md)
and analyze the input code and predict the visual output:

4. [Decode
   1](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/week3/decode1.js)
5. [Decode
   2](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s25/blob/main/week3/decode2.js)

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Last week’s exercises used loops to repeat code. This week the idea is to
  practice using a loop’s local variable to increase values in the repeating
  code and increment visual characteristics to create a pattern(s). (You
  actually did this with the Decode 1 example last week, too.) This week's
  historical references do the same and also introduce random variation,
  sometimes to affect every element and other times to “interrupt” the repeating
  elements. Again, we’re working along the spectrum of structure and randomness.
- Building on the skills from Part 1, recode one of the examples from this
  week’s featured artists. Or draw inspiration form some contemporary artists
  linked below. Or use an element previously created for this course (or another
  one) to generate a pattern and integrate random variation(s) in some way. If
  you worked in the grid with random features for the open-ended homework last
  week, then you're welcome to push that farther if you like. Everyone is
  welcome to work from inspiration you find anywhere! Be sure to consider all
  the possible visual characteristics to modify. Animation and interaction are
  encouraged for even more variation.
- **Important:** For this part, **do not** use GitHub Copilot. Focus on applying what you've learned independently to deepen your coding skills.

### Part 3: AI Experimentation

- Extend your code form Part 2 with AI and ask Copilot to introduce a new feature to your sketch, such as:
  - Adding animation or interaction
  - Introducing random variations in shape, size, or color
  - Transforming the pattern(s) using rotations or translations

### Part 4: Document

- Document your work. Keep working in VS Code, and paste any final code to the
  p5 web editor so you can link to your sketches in your documentation. I know
  this is redundant, but it's still the easiest way to share. Link
  to your sketches from Parts 1-3.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the exercises
  **with and without AI**:
  - What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you?
  - Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  - Were there moments where you were tempted to use Copilot but didn’t?
  - What did you learn from coding independently in Part 2?
  - What was your process for extending your code with GitHub Copilot?
  - Reflect on your discoveries and challenges, noting where AI was helpful or
    limiting.
  - How did its contributions differ from your independent version?
  - Were there any unexpected outcomes?
