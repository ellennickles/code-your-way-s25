## Assignment

### Part 1: Document and Keep Going

- **Analyze** • Reflect on your user testing and feedback results. Summarize key
  insights: What worked well? What surprised you? Were there any consistent
  themes or contrasting opinions?
- **Prioritize** • Update your priority list based on your insights. Clearly
  identify what changes or improvements you'll focus on next, and explain your
  rationale.
- **Progress** • Document the work you complete this week. Highlight significant
  milestones, technical accomplishments, unexpected challenges, or
  breakthroughs.
- **Resources** • Include links to updated code, sketches, prototypes, or other
  relevant references. Cite all resources, including AI tools or external
  tutorials, if applicable.

### Part 2: Presentation Preparation

- Next week, you'll present your project to the entire class and our special guest, John Henry Thompson—a legendary interactive media artist, researcher, and professor ([personal
  site](https://johnhenrythompson.com/johnhenrythompson/index.html) and [ITP/IMA
  bio](https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/john-henry-thompson/)).
- **Presentation Strategy** • Plan how you’ll introduce your project clearly and
  concisely within about ~three (3) minutes. What aspects should you highlight
  to get the most useful feedback?
- **Directing Feedback** • Consider your feedback experience this week:
  - If you didn't receive the type of feedback you needed, how can you reframe
    or clarify your presentation next week?
  - Include at least one (1) specific question to guide feedback. Make sure your
    question aligns with your project's current stage and your personal goals or
    experience level.
- After next week's presentation, you'll have three (3) solid weeks to further
  refine and complete your project.
