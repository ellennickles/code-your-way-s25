## Assignment

We are now entering the second phase of the course: a supportive environment for
self-directed project development within our learning community. This phase is
structured to help you successfully complete either one comprehensive project or
a series of smaller, related projects (such as creating multiple portfolio
pieces). Use this opportunity to achieve your individual goals, whether it's
advancing your creative portfolio or diving deeply into a single, ambitious
project.

There is no requirement to use specific programming concepts or tools. Instead, focus on an idea that excites you and choose the most suitable programming methods to help you realize it. You may build upon something you've already created for this course or another, or you can start something entirely new!

As we move forward, future class sessions could involve activities such as:

- individual or collaborative work on your projects;
- sharing and learning skills, techniques, and resources;
- regular progress sharing and constructive peer feedback;
- user testing sessions;
- one-on-one conferences with me for personalized support;
- exploring topics together if common interests or needs arise.

To start this process, craft a proposal to share with our class. This proposal serves two purposes: (1) helping you articulate your ideas clearly and (2) inviting constructive feedback from peers regarding next steps, overall direction, useful resources, and any other guidance you might need.

### Part 1: Project Proposal

Research your project idea, collect notes addressing the following prompts, and
prepare to share your proposal in class next week:

- Project Overview
  - Ideas for a project title?
  - Provide a clear description of your idea (max 100 words).
  - What would you like to achieve by the end of this project?
  - Do you believe this project can realistically be completed within 7 weeks
    Explain why or why not, and describe your backup plan or possible
    adjustments if needed.
- Audience and User Experience
  - Who is the primary audience or user of your project? (It's okay if the user
    is yourself!)
  - Briefly describe how the user will interact with or experience your project.
    What do you want them to feel or take away from it?
- Creative Vision
  - What is your creative angle or aesthetic style for this project? What mood
    or visual approach are you aiming for?
  - Cite sources of inspirations (e.g., quotes, photos, artworks, products,
    people, music, current events), and briefly explain how each inspiration
    connects to your project’s concept or aesthetic.
- Technical Considerations
  - List any tools, programming languages, hardware, software, or libraries you
    plan to use, and explain briefly why these are necessary.
  - Identify any existing content, sketches, or code you can utilize (your own
    or others', clearly citing sources).
  - Outline what new content, code, visuals, or other assets you’ll need to
    produce.
  - Which resources (tutorials, websites, examples, etc.) will you rely on for
    support or guidance?
- Reflection and Feedback
  - What aspects of your project (conceptual, technical, or otherwise) are you
      currently unsure about?
  - Identify specific areas or questions where you’d appreciate input, advice,
    or ideas from your peers.
- [Submit your proposal here](https://forms.gle/CJZMpMpTeDxpvWv18)

### Part 2: In-Class Presentation

- Decide how to best present your proposal to the class in a way that clearly
  communicates your main idea, goals, and questions.
- Prepare a concise presentation of your proposal (~3 minutes) [UPDATED] for the class
  next week, clearly communicating your main idea, goals, and key questions.
  Focus on highlighting essential and engaging points, including:
  - What excites you most about your project?
  - What are your main uncertainties or challenges?
  - What specific areas would you like feedback or suggestions on?
- Use this opportunity intentionally to gather constructive insights and
  practical advice that will help you advance your project effectively.
