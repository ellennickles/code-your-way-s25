## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to begin working on your independent project by creating a "[Hello
World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)" version—a simple, foundational step that gets you started. Depending on your project, this can take different forms, but the idea is to **start doing and making** rather than getting stuck in over-planning.

Your first attempt does not need to be polished, perfect, or even fully functional. Think of Anne Lamott’s "[Shitty First
Drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf)" from Bird by Bird—just get something down so you have something to build on.

### Part 1: Define Your Hello World Goal

Use the SMART criteria below (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to create a clear and realistic roadmap for yourself this week:

#### Is your project goal…

##### ...product-oriented? (I want to make X or a series of Xs)

- If you are starting a new project, make one bare-bones piece of functionality.
- If you are making a custom website, publish your [Hello World
  site](https://ellennicklesdemo.github.io/helloworld/) on a static hosting
  service such as [GitHub
  Pages](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/version-control-guides/tips-and-tricks.md#github-pages),
  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), etc.
- If you are returning to a previous project, focus on one area this week:
  - Does it need a major refactor session?
  - Expanded functionality?
  - Graphic design updates?
  - Deployment to a live environment?
  - [web accessibility
  standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
  improvements?
- If you are working on a series of related code-driven pieces, create at least
  one piece to share next week.

##### ...process-oriented? (I want to learn, practice, or improve X)

- If you are learning a new programming library (e.g., Three.js) or practicing a
  technique/strategy, create at least one experiment to apply your understanding
  and start building momentum.
- If you are improving a previously-learned coding skill or strategy, show your
  progress through:
  - Re-making something you built earlier from scratch.
  - Refactoring an old project to improve structure and efficiency.
  - Annotating previous code to explain it better.
  - Recording a short walkthrough explaining how a piece of code works.

If you’re unsure which approach applies to your project, start small: experiment with a basic prototype, reflect on what you learn, and let that guide you forward.

#### Use [SMART Goals Criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) to guide your work

Create a realistic roadmap for yourself this week that answers the following questions:

1. Specific
    - What is your project's Hello World? Be specific.
    - This is the mission statement for your goal.
    - What actions will you take? Don’t hesitate to get very detailed.
2. Measurable
    - What does success for your goal look like? (How much? How well?)
    - Are there specific tasks and deadlines to set as milestones in order to
      complete the main goal?
3. Achievable
   - Is this goal realistic and doable within a week?
   - Consider any obstacles requirements and ask yourself:
     - Does this goal inspire motivation or feel discouraging? If it feels
       overwhelming, how can you simplify it?
     - What technologies, skills, or tools are required?
     - What resources will support your work? (e.g., books, websites, tutorials,
       documentation, example projects)
     - What assets, content, or code do you already have?
     - What still needs to be created?
     - If you’re missing something, how will you get it? (e.g., research,
       practice, external support)
   - Do you need to adjust your expectations to make this goal more achievable?
4. Relevant
    - How does this step connect to your overall project goals?
    - What will it help you do next?
5. Time-bound
    - Can you complete it in a week?
    - What’s a reasonable timeline for each step?
    - Setting realistic timing improves your chances of succeeding.
    - Time constraints also create a sense of urgency.

Guide](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf) (PDF)

### Part 2: Create [Hello World](https://ellennicklesdemo.github.io/helloworld/)

Using your SMART goal as a guide, build your first version!

- This can be a simple experiment, a proof-of-concept, or an early attempt at
  functionality.
- If you're feeling stuck, lower the bar further: What's the absolute smallest
  version you can create? A single function? A basic animation? A title screen?
  Just start somewhere.

### Part 3: Assess and Document

- At the end of the week, reflect on your progress:
  - What puzzle(s) did you set out to solve?
  - What did you try? What worked? What didn’t?
  - Did you run into unexpected challenges or breakthroughs?
  - Do you need to adjust your approach, timeline, or resources?
  - Revisit your original proposal. Does anything need to change?
- Document your process and progress:
  - Include links to your code and any references used.
  - Cite any AI-generated code or documentation, noting how you used AI in your
    process.
