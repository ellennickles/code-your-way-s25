## Assignment

### Part 1: Finish your project

### Part 2: Document your project

- Document your final project in a blog post (or equivalent format).
- It’s up to you to decide the best way to document it, but here are some loose
  guidelines to consider:
  - **Title and/or one-sentence description**
  - **Link to project** (if online)
  - **Project summary** (250-500 words)
  - **Inspiration** • How did you become interested in this idea? (Think:
    quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events,
    social issues, etc.)
  - **Process** • How did you make this? What was easy to implement? What was
    difficult? Did you encounter unexpected challenges or breakthroughs? Do your
    best to explain why something worked—or why it didn’t.
  - **Audience/context** • Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it
    interactive? Practical? Just for fun? Emotional? Provocative?
  - **Code references** • What examples, tutorials, or references did you use to
    create the project?
  - **Next steps** • If you had (or have) more time to work on this, what would
    (or will) you do next?

### Part 3: Share your project and your approach to programming

- Prepare a ~three (3) minute presentation about your project that
  1. Describes what you made
  2. Reflects on your approach to making it
- Ideally, you not only learned more about your topic, but also more about your
  _approach_ to developing code-driven projects. We’re excited to hear about
  both!
- While everyone’s process is different and every project has unique conceptual
  and technical considerations, try to frame your reflection as general tips and
  strategies that could help your classmates in their current and future
  projects.
- Some prompts to consider:
  - How do you approach learning a new function, technique, framework,
    etc.? What helps you learn something new in this field?
  - What attitudes, methods, or resources help you persevere through challenging
    programming moments?
  - Do you notice any patterns in how you work? (e.g. Are there common
    roadblocks you encounter? Certain stages that come more easily?)
  - Did this project reveal anything you might focus on to become a more
    proficient coder or achieve your goals?
- Feel free to include questions to guide the feedback you’d like to receive on
  your project or approach!
