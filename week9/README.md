## Assignment

### Part 1: Create a User-Testable Version of Your Project

- Continue developing your project this week with the goal of sharing it next
  week for feedback from our group. Although your project may still be in early
  stages, try to test **one key aspect** of your idea or explore the next step
  in its development.
- What makes this version “user-testable”? That will depend on your project. It
  might be an interactive element, a visual or audio component, a system
  behavior, or a sequence of actions.
- Think about:
  - What specific part of your project do you want to test right now?
  - Why is this part important to test?
  - What kind of response or feedback are you hoping to get—and why?

### Part 2: Assess and Document Your Process

- Reflect on your work this week:
  - What puzzle(s) did you try to solve?
  - What did you try, and what were the outcomes? (Include both successes and
    failed experiments.)
  - Did you encounter any unexpected challenges or breakthroughs?
  - Do you need to revise the original goals in your proposal or shift your
    approach?
  - Are there new resources, tools, or collaborators you might need?
- For user testing, prepare **a few open-ended questions** that target specific
  aspects of your project. Think about what kind of feedback will be most
  helpful for guiding your next steps.
- Finally, include:
  - Any relevant links to your code, documentation, or media
  - Citations for references or source materials (including AI tools, if used)
