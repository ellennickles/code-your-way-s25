# Week 12 • Individual Meetings

## Assignment

- You’ve now got a plan for the next two (2) weeks. You know what to do. If you
  find yourself needing to adjust your focus or strategy, that’s totally okay.

  user testing. You can choose to focus on one or the other, or a bit of both.
- **To help me plan a class session that supports both your individual goals and
  the needs of the group, please submit a short project update by Sunday night,
  April 27, that includes:**
  - A summary of your progress on your timeline so far
  - What you aim to accomplish during next week's class time and also the final
    week of the semester
  - If you’re user testing: What are you testing, and why?
  - If you’re working solo: What task(s) or question(s) are you focusing on?
